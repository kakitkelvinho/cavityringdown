# Ringdown 

## Introduction 

This is a package for analyzing the timetrace of a cavity ringdown experiment.

## Usage

This package makes no assumptions about how to run your experiments and how you store your data. What it requires is an array of time and and array of the intensity. By passing on these two arrays, in other words the $x$ and $y$ of your experiment, it can fit to it and tell you the decay time constants of experiment.
